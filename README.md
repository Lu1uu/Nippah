The question is "Why bother making your own anime list tracker when there are 3 really popular, well made sites?" <br>
* MAL
* Kitsu
* Anilist

My answer: Because I want to >:( and it helped me to learn how to make more complex vue applications.


## What was used to make this?
Everything here is custom, the css, the components, and so, even if it doesnt look amazing, im really proud of this project.
## Disclaimer
This website was my first attempt at a full stack app, that means the code is very inefficient and messy, and should not be used as an example for your own.
I learned a lot about how single page applications handle authentication, and I hope to make a better version in the distant future.
